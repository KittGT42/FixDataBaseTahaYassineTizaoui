Q: Is it easy for makeup to fall off due to sweating?
A: Hairline powder is created out of nothing. The powder is wrapped in a mixed oil film and is highly waterproof.

Use a dry tissue to gently press it after sweating to prevent makeup from blurring.

A: It can be partially cleaned with facial cleanser or makeup remover, or it can be easily washed off with shampoo when washing your hair. It is easy to remove and leaves no residue.

Work the serum through the hair between the palms of your hands for 1 to 2 minutes. Rinse thoroughly.OverviewWhen hair is damaged, its molecular structure, composed of peptides, is compromised. Hair breaks, becomes too elastic, with no movement. But most peptides are too big to be reinjected into the fiber, making damage almost irreversible. Scientific discovery – Absolut Repair Molecular. Repair 2 years of damage in one use. ​

For the first time, L’Oréal Advanced Research achieved to decompose peptides, to inject their components separately into the fiber. Once inside, they reform & rebuild the molecular structure of the hair.

More than surface repair, it is inner molecular repair. This exclusive rinse-off serum, highly concentrated with 2% Peptides bonder + 5 amino acids, rebuilds the hair molecular structure to restore its strength, elasticity and movement.​

[DEEP PENETRATION]​
Inspired by ultra-potent skincare serums, it goes beyond regular repair masks and deeply penetrates into the fiber to rebuild its molecular structure with no superficial coating.​

[INSTANT TRANSFORMATION]
Instantly, hair is visibly transformed: shine and smoothness are dramatically improved. ​

Q&A:
Q: Is it easy for makeup to fall off due to sweating?
A: Hairline powder is created out of nothing. The powder is wrapped in a mixed oil film and is highly waterproof. It can solve the problem of makeup removal due to sweat and will not take away moisture from the skin to achieve a long-lasting color fixing effect. Try not to rub your makeup after applying it. Use a dry tissue to gently press it after sweating to prevent makeup from blurring.
Q:How to clean?
A: It can be partially cleaned with facial cleanser or makeup remover, or it can be easily washed off with shampoo when washing your hair. It is easy to remove and leaves no residue.

4 Reasons why KOLESTON is the color for you! 
 Easy to apply and does not drop.Covers even the most resistant grey hair perfectly and durably.Gives luscious colour full of irresistible shine!Conditions with Oil ReplacementRenders a hassle-free application with long-lasting effectOverview1 Preparation of coloring emulsion:
Press the content of the tube into a non-metallic dish (plastic, glass or porcelain), then add the developer fluid and mix the two ingredients with a coloring brush until a homogeneous coloring emulsion is produced. Please apply the emulsion to your hair as soon as you have finished mixing it to achieve an optimum coloring result.

2 Application of coloring emulsion:
For first coloring, the coloring emulsion is applied to unwashed hair strand by strand, using the coloring brush. Please make sure that you do not miss any strands. Then comb your hair thorough with a wide-toothed comb to achieve even distribution of the coloring emulsion in your hair. For root coloring, make partings in your hair and apply the coloring emulsion to the roots. After allowing soaking time of 20 minutes, comb the coloring emulsion evenly right down to the ends of your hair.

3 Soaking time:
The soaking time is 30 minutes; for root coloring it is 20 minutes for the roots and another 10 minutes for the whole of your hair. The color of the color emulsion may change during the soaking time.

4 Finishing treatment: with oil replacement:
Condition with oil replacement cream
Rinse until water runs clear (using shampoo is not recommended).
Apply the Oil Replacement Sachet.
Leave on for 2 minutes and Rinse again.","SpecificationsColour NameSpecial Light Ash Blonde 309/1DepartmentWomenWhat's In The BoxIntense Color Cream, Oil Based Developer, Our Exclusive Color Reactivator, 2 Advanced Intense Gloss TreatmentsTarget Hair TypeAll Hair TypesFormationCreamHair Treatment TypeGloss & ShineShelf Life3 yearModel NumberC959329",Model Number : C959329,Hair Color,WELLA,['Hair & Scalp'],[],Other,Hair loss,4.807467878804493

After allowing soaking time of 20 minutes comb the colouring emulsion evenly right down the ends of your hair. Step 3: Soaking TimeThe soaking time is 30 minutes; for the root colouring it is 20 minutes for the roots and another 10 minutes for the whole of your hair. The colour of the Colour Emulsion may change during the soaking time. Rinse until water runs clear (using shampoo is not recommended).Step 4: Application of Moisturizing Treatment with Argan Oil Apply the Moisturizing Treatment with Argan Oil.

Press the content of the tube into a non-metallic dish (plastic, glass or porcelain), then add the developer fluid and mix the two ingredients with a coloring brush until a homogeneous coloring emulsion is produced. Please apply the emulsion to your hair as soon as you have finished mixing it to achieve an optimum coloring result.

2 Application of coloring emulsion:
For first coloring, the coloring emulsion is applied to unwashed hair strand by strand, using the coloring brush. Please make sure that you do not miss any strands. Then comb your hair thorough with a wide-toothed comb to achieve even distribution of the coloring emulsion in your hair. For root coloring, make partings in your hair and apply the coloring emulsion to the roots. After allowing soaking time of 20 minutes, comb the coloring emulsion evenly right down to the ends of your hair.

3 Soaking time:
The soaking time is 30 minutes; for root coloring it is 20 minutes for the roots and another 10 minutes for the whole of your hair. The color of the color emulsion may change during the soaking time.

Step 2: Application of Colouring EmulsionFor first colouring, the colouring emulsion is applied to unwashed hair strand by strand, using the colouring brush. Please make sure that you do not miss any strands. Then comb your hair through with a wide-toothed comb to achieve even distribution of the colouring emulsion in your hair. For the root colouring, make partings in your hair and apply the colouring emulsion to the roots. After allowing soaking time of 20 minutes comb the colouring emulsion evenly right down the ends of your hair. Step 3: Soaking TimeThe soaking time is 30 minutes; for the root colouring it is 20 minutes for the roots and another 10 minutes for the whole of your hair. The colour of the Colour Emulsion may change during the soaking time. Rinse until water runs clear (using shampoo is not recommended).

Press the content of the tube into a non-metallic dish (plastic, glass or porcelain), then add the developer fluid and mix the two ingredients with a colouring brush until a homogeneous colouring emulsion is produced. Please apply the emulsion to your hair as soon as you have finished mixing it to achieve an optimum colouring result. Step 2: Application of Colouring EmulsionFor first colouring, the colouring emulsion is applied to unwashed hair strand by strand, using the colouring brush. Please make sure that you do not miss any strands. Then comb your hair through with a wide-toothed comb to achieve even distribution of the colouring emulsion in your hair. For the root colouring, make partings in your hair and apply the colouring emulsion to the roots. After allowing soaking time of 20 minutes comb the colouring emulsion evenly right down the ends of your hair. Step 3: Soaking TimeThe soaking time is 30 minutes; for the root colouring it is 20 minutes for the roots and another 10 minutes for the whole of your hair. The colour of the Colour Emulsion may change during the soaking time. Rinse until water runs clear (using shampoo is not recommended).Step 4: Application of Moisturizing Treatment with Argan Oil Apply the Moisturizing Treatment with Argan Oil.

After allowing soaking time of 20 minutes comb the colouring emulsion evenly right down the ends of your hair. Step 3: Soaking TimeThe soaking time is 30 minutes; for the root colouring it is 20 minutes for the roots and another 10 minutes for the whole of your hair. The colour of the Colour Emulsion may change during the soaking time.

For root coloring, make partings in your hair and apply the coloring emulsion to the roots. After allowing soaking time of 20 minutes, comb the coloring emulsion evenly right down to the ends of your hair.

3 Soaking time:
The soaking time is 30 minutes; for root coloring it is 20 minutes for the roots and another 10 minutes for the whole of your hair. The color of the color emulsion may change during the soaking time.

 Easy to apply and does not drop.Covers even the most resistant grey hair perfectly and durably.Gives luscious colour full of irresistible shine!Conditions with Oil ReplacementMoisturising, caring conditioner enriched with royal jelly makes hair satin soft and healthy with exceptional shineOverview1 Preparation of coloring emulsion:
Press the content of the tube into a non-metallic dish (plastic, glass or porcelain), then add the developer fluid and mix the two ingredients with a coloring brush until a homogeneous coloring emulsion is produced. Please apply the emulsion to your hair as soon as you have finished mixing it to achieve an optimum coloring result.

2 Application of coloring emulsion:
For first coloring, the coloring emulsion is applied to unwashed hair strand by strand, using the coloring brush. Please make sure that you do not miss any strands. Then comb your hair thorough with a wide-toothed comb to achieve even distribution of the coloring emulsion in your hair. For root coloring, make partings in your hair and apply the coloring emulsion to the roots. After allowing soaking time of 20 minutes, comb the coloring emulsion evenly right down to the ends of your hair.

3 Soaking time:
The soaking time is 30 minutes; for root coloring it is 20 minutes for the roots and another 10 minutes for the whole of your hair. The color of the color emulsion may change during the soaking time.

4 Finishing treatment: with oil replacement:
Condition with oil replacement cream
Rinse until water runs clear (using shampoo is not recommended).
Apply the Oil Replacement Sachet.
Leave on for 2 minutes and Rinse again.",SpecificationsColour NameMatte Medium Blonde 307/2DepartmentUnisexTarget Skin TypeNormalTarget Hair TypeAll Hair TypesFormationLiquidShelf Life3 yearModel NumberC959321,Model Number : C959321,Hair Color,WELLA,['Hair & Scalp'],[],Conditioner,Hair loss,3.3958797346140273

4 Reasons why KOLESTON is the color for you! 
 Easy to apply and does not drop.Covers even the most resistant grey hair perfectly and durably.Gives luscious colour full of irresistible shine!Conditions with Oil ReplacementOverview1 Preparation of coloring emulsion:
Press the content of the tube into a non-metallic dish (plastic, glass or porcelain), then add the developer fluid and mix the two ingredients with a coloring brush until a homogeneous coloring emulsion is produced. Please apply the emulsion to your hair as soon as you have finished mixing it to achieve an optimum coloring result.

2 Application of coloring emulsion:
For first coloring, the coloring emulsion is applied to unwashed hair strand by strand, using the coloring brush. Please make sure that you do not miss any strands. Then comb your hair thorough with a wide-toothed comb to achieve even distribution of the coloring emulsion in your hair. For root coloring, make partings in your hair and apply the coloring emulsion to the roots. After allowing soaking time of 20 minutes, comb the coloring emulsion evenly right down to the ends of your hair.

3 Soaking time:
The soaking time is 30 minutes; for root coloring it is 20 minutes for the roots and another 10 minutes for the whole of your hair. The color of the color emulsion may change during the soaking time.

4 Finishing treatment: with oil replacement:
Condition with oil replacement cream
Rinse until water runs clear (using shampoo is not recommended).
Apply the Oil Replacement Sachet.

 Easy to apply and does not drop.Covers even the most resistant grey hair perfectly and durably.Gives luscious colour full of irresistible shine!Conditions with Oil ReplacementExpress retouch gray hair concealer for a temporary hair color solution to cover gray hairOverview1 Preparation of coloring emulsion:
Press the content of the tube into a non-metallic dish (plastic, glass or porcelain), then add the developer fluid and mix the two ingredients with a coloring brush until a homogeneous coloring emulsion is produced. Please apply the emulsion to your hair as soon as you have finished mixing it to achieve an optimum coloring result.

2 Application of coloring emulsion:
For first coloring, the coloring emulsion is applied to unwashed hair strand by strand, using the coloring brush. Please make sure that you do not miss any strands. Then comb your hair thorough with a wide-toothed comb to achieve even distribution of the coloring emulsion in your hair. For root coloring, make partings in your hair and apply the coloring emulsion to the roots. After allowing soaking time of 20 minutes, comb the coloring emulsion evenly right down to the ends of your hair.

3 Soaking time:
The soaking time is 30 minutes; for root coloring it is 20 minutes for the roots and another 10 minutes for the whole of your hair. The color of the color emulsion may change during the soaking time.

4 Finishing treatment: with oil replacement:
Condition with oil replacement cream

 Easy to apply and does not drop.Covers even the most resistant grey hair perfectly and durably.Gives luscious colour full of irresistible shine!Conditions with Oil ReplacementInfused with deep-infusion technology and micro-fine pigments that ensures enhanced penetrationOverview1 Preparation of coloring emulsion:
Press the content of the tube into a non-metallic dish (plastic, glass or porcelain), then add the developer fluid and mix the two ingredients with a coloring brush until a homogeneous coloring emulsion is produced. Please apply the emulsion to your hair as soon as you have finished mixing it to achieve an optimum coloring result.

2 Application of coloring emulsion:
For first coloring, the coloring emulsion is applied to unwashed hair strand by strand, using the coloring brush. Please make sure that you do not miss any strands. Then comb your hair thorough with a wide-toothed comb to achieve even distribution of the coloring emulsion in your hair. For root coloring, make partings in your hair and apply the coloring emulsion to the roots. After allowing soaking time of 20 minutes, comb the coloring emulsion evenly right down to the ends of your hair.

3 Soaking time:
The soaking time is 30 minutes; for root coloring it is 20 minutes for the roots and another 10 minutes for the whole of your hair. The color of the color emulsion may change during the soaking time.

4 Finishing treatment: with oil replacement:
Condition with oil replacement cream
Rinse until water runs clear (using shampoo is not recommended).
Apply the Oil Replacement Sachet.

4 Reasons why KOLESTON is the color for you! 
 Easy to apply and does not drop.Covers even the most resistant grey hair perfectly and durably.Gives luscious colour full of irresistible shine!Conditions with Oil ReplacementOverview1 Preparation of coloring emulsion:
Press the content of the tube into a non-metallic dish (plastic, glass or porcelain), then add the developer fluid and mix the two ingredients with a coloring brush until a homogeneous coloring emulsion is produced. Please apply the emulsion to your hair as soon as you have finished mixing it to achieve an optimum coloring result.

2 Application of coloring emulsion:
For first coloring, the coloring emulsion is applied to unwashed hair strand by strand, using the coloring brush. Please make sure that you do not miss any strands. Then comb your hair thorough with a wide-toothed comb to achieve even distribution of the coloring emulsion in your hair. For root coloring, make partings in your hair and apply the coloring emulsion to the roots. After allowing soaking time of 20 minutes, comb the coloring emulsion evenly right down to the ends of your hair.

3 Soaking time:
The soaking time is 30 minutes; for root coloring it is 20 minutes for the roots and another 10 minutes for the whole of your hair. The color of the color emulsion may change during the soaking time.

4 Finishing treatment: with oil replacement:

4 Reasons why KOLESTON is the color for you! 
 Easy to apply and does not drop.Covers even the most resistant grey hair perfectly and durably.Gives luscious colour full of irresistible shine!Conditions with Oil ReplacementOverview1 Preparation of coloring emulsion:
Press the content of the tube into a non-metallic dish (plastic, glass or porcelain), then add the developer fluid and mix the two ingredients with a coloring brush until a homogeneous coloring emulsion is produced. Please apply the emulsion to your hair as soon as you have finished mixing it to achieve an optimum coloring result.

2 Application of coloring emulsion:
For first coloring, the coloring emulsion is applied to unwashed hair strand by strand, using the coloring brush. Please make sure that you do not miss any strands. Then comb your hair thorough with a wide-toothed comb to achieve even distribution of the coloring emulsion in your hair. For root coloring, make partings in your hair and apply the coloring emulsion to the roots. After allowing soaking time of 20 minutes, comb the coloring emulsion evenly right down to the ends of your hair.

3 Soaking time:
The soaking time is 30 minutes; for root coloring it is 20 minutes for the roots and another 10 minutes for the whole of your hair. The color of the color emulsion may change during the soaking time.

4 Finishing treatment: with oil replacement:
Condition with oil replacement cream
Rinse until water runs clear (using shampoo is not recommended).
Apply the Oil Replacement Sachet.
Leave on for 2 minutes and Rinse again.",SpecificationsColour NameChocolate Brown 306/7DepartmentWomenTarget Hair TypeAll Hair TypesHair Treatment TypeGloss & ShineShelf Life3 yearModel NumberC959317,Model Number : C959317,Hair Color,WELLA,['Hair & Scalp'],[],Hair Color,Hair loss,4.050598690831078

After allowing soaking time of 20 minutes comb the colouring emulsion evenly right down the ends of your hair. Step 3: Soaking TimeThe soaking time is 30 minutes; for the root colouring it is 20 minutes for the roots and another 10 minutes for the whole of your hair. The colour of the Colour Emulsion may change during the soaking time.

Press the content of the tube into a non-metallic dish (plastic, glass or porcelain), then add the developer fluid and mix the two ingredients with a colouring brush until a homogeneous colouring emulsion is produced. Please apply the emulsion to your hair as soon as you have finished mixing it to achieve an optimum colouring result. Step 2: Application of Colouring EmulsionFor first colouring, the colouring emulsion is applied to unwashed hair strand by strand, using the colouring brush. Please make sure that you do not miss any strands. Then comb your hair through with a wide-toothed comb to achieve even distribution of the colouring emulsion in your hair. For the root colouring, make partings in your hair and apply the colouring emulsion to the roots. After allowing soaking time of 20 minutes comb the colouring emulsion evenly right down the ends of your hair. Step 3: Soaking TimeThe soaking time is 30 minutes; for the root colouring it is 20 minutes for the roots and another 10 minutes for the whole of your hair. The colour of the Colour Emulsion may change during the soaking time. Rinse until water runs clear (using shampoo is not recommended).Step 4: Application of Moisturizing Treatment with Argan Oil Apply the Moisturizing Treatment with Argan Oil.

 Easy to apply and does not drop.Covers even the most resistant grey hair perfectly and durably.Gives luscious colour full of irresistible shine!Conditions with Oil ReplacementPackaging may varyOverview1 Preparation of coloring emulsion:
Press the content of the tube into a non-metallic dish (plastic, glass or porcelain), then add the developer fluid and mix the two ingredients with a coloring brush until a homogeneous coloring emulsion is produced. Please apply the emulsion to your hair as soon as you have finished mixing it to achieve an optimum coloring result.

2 Application of coloring emulsion:
For first coloring, the coloring emulsion is applied to unwashed hair strand by strand, using the coloring brush. Please make sure that you do not miss any strands. Then comb your hair thorough with a wide-toothed comb to achieve even distribution of the coloring emulsion in your hair. For root coloring, make partings in your hair and apply the coloring emulsion to the roots. After allowing soaking time of 20 minutes, comb the coloring emulsion evenly right down to the ends of your hair.

3 Soaking time:
The soaking time is 30 minutes; for root coloring it is 20 minutes for the roots and another 10 minutes for the whole of your hair. The color of the color emulsion may change during the soaking time.

4 Finishing treatment: with oil replacement:

4 Reasons why KOLESTON is the color for you! 
 Easy to apply and does not drop.Covers even the most resistant grey hair perfectly and durably.Gives luscious colour full of irresistible shine!Conditions with Oil ReplacementOverview1 Preparation of coloring emulsion:
Press the content of the tube into a non-metallic dish (plastic, glass or porcelain), then add the developer fluid and mix the two ingredients with a coloring brush until a homogeneous coloring emulsion is produced. Please apply the emulsion to your hair as soon as you have finished mixing it to achieve an optimum coloring result.

2 Application of coloring emulsion:
For first coloring, the coloring emulsion is applied to unwashed hair strand by strand, using the coloring brush. Please make sure that you do not miss any strands. Then comb your hair thorough with a wide-toothed comb to achieve even distribution of the coloring emulsion in your hair. For root coloring, make partings in your hair and apply the coloring emulsion to the roots. After allowing soaking time of 20 minutes, comb the coloring emulsion evenly right down to the ends of your hair.

3 Soaking time:
The soaking time is 30 minutes; for root coloring it is 20 minutes for the roots and another 10 minutes for the whole of your hair. The color of the color emulsion may change during the soaking time.

4 Finishing treatment: with oil replacement:
Condition with oil replacement cream

Pack Contents - 1 x tube of permanent colour cream, 1 x bottle of colour developer, 1 x moisturizing treatment with Argan Oil, Gloves + Leaflet. How To Use - Step 1: Preparation of Colouring EmulsionPut on gloves. Press the content of the tube into a non-metallic dish (plastic, glass or porcelain), then add the developer fluid and mix the two ingredients with a colouring brush until a homogeneous colouring emulsion is produced. Please apply the emulsion to your hair as soon as you have finished mixing it to achieve an optimum colouring result. Step 2: Application of Colouring EmulsionFor first colouring, the colouring emulsion is applied to unwashed hair strand by strand, using the colouring brush. Please make sure that you do not miss any strands. Then comb your hair through with a wide-toothed comb to achieve even distribution of the colouring emulsion in your hair. For the root colouring, make partings in your hair and apply the colouring emulsion to the roots. After allowing soaking time of 20 minutes comb the colouring emulsion evenly right down the ends of your hair. Step 3: Soaking TimeThe soaking time is 30 minutes; for the root colouring it is 20 minutes for the roots and another 10 minutes for the whole of your hair. The colour of the Colour Emulsion may change during the soaking time.

History:
All Aleppo Liquid Soap products are made in France, within the NAJJAR Laboratory, using organic olive oil and bay laurel oil.
Invented in 1964 by the grandfather of Mr NAJJAR, the current CEO, the formulation of this Aleppo Liquid Soap comes from hot process saponification of these two plant oils.

4 Reasons why KOLESTON is the color for you! 
 Easy to apply and does not drop.Covers even the most resistant grey hair perfectly and durably.Gives luscious colour full of irresistible shine!Conditions with Oil ReplacementOverview1 Preparation of coloring emulsion:
Press the content of the tube into a non-metallic dish (plastic, glass or porcelain), then add the developer fluid and mix the two ingredients with a coloring brush until a homogeneous coloring emulsion is produced. Please apply the emulsion to your hair as soon as you have finished mixing it to achieve an optimum coloring result.

2 Application of coloring emulsion:
For first coloring, the coloring emulsion is applied to unwashed hair strand by strand, using the coloring brush. Please make sure that you do not miss any strands. Then comb your hair thorough with a wide-toothed comb to achieve even distribution of the coloring emulsion in your hair. For root coloring, make partings in your hair and apply the coloring emulsion to the roots. After allowing soaking time of 20 minutes, comb the coloring emulsion evenly right down to the ends of your hair.

3 Soaking time:
The soaking time is 30 minutes; for root coloring it is 20 minutes for the roots and another 10 minutes for the whole of your hair. The color of the color emulsion may change during the soaking time.

4 Finishing treatment: with oil replacement:
Condition with oil replacement cream
Rinse until water runs clear (using shampoo is not recommended).
Apply the Oil Replacement Sachet.

4 Reasons why KOLESTON is the color for you! 
 Easy to apply and does not drop.Covers even the most resistant grey hair perfectly and durably.Gives luscious colour full of irresistible shine!Conditions with Oil ReplacementOverview1 Preparation of coloring emulsion:
Press the content of the tube into a non-metallic dish (plastic, glass or porcelain), then add the developer fluid and mix the two ingredients with a coloring brush until a homogeneous coloring emulsion is produced. Please apply the emulsion to your hair as soon as you have finished mixing it to achieve an optimum coloring result.

2 Application of coloring emulsion:
For first coloring, the coloring emulsion is applied to unwashed hair strand by strand, using the coloring brush. Please make sure that you do not miss any strands. Then comb your hair thorough with a wide-toothed comb to achieve even distribution of the coloring emulsion in your hair. For root coloring, make partings in your hair and apply the coloring emulsion to the roots. After allowing soaking time of 20 minutes, comb the coloring emulsion evenly right down to the ends of your hair.

3 Soaking time:
The soaking time is 30 minutes; for root coloring it is 20 minutes for the roots and another 10 minutes for the whole of your hair. The color of the color emulsion may change during the soaking time.

4 Finishing treatment: with oil replacement:
Condition with oil replacement cream
Rinse until water runs clear (using shampoo is not recommended).
Apply the Oil Replacement Sachet.

This carefully crafted formula is designed to revitalize your hair and encourage its natural growth, leaving you with healthier, stronger, and more beautiful locks. The powerful blend of rosemary and mint provides a refreshing and rejuvenating experience for your scalp. Rosemary, known for its stimulating properties, helps increase blood circulation to the hair follicles. This improved circulation ensures that the hair follicles receive essential nutrients and oxygen, promoting healthy hair growth from the roots. Additionally, rosemary helps to combat scalp irritation, inflammation, and dandruff, creating an ideal environment for hair to flourish. Mint, with its cooling and soothing effects, complements rosemary by providing a refreshing sensation to the scalp. It helps to alleviate scalp discomfort, reduce itchiness, and regulate oil production. By maintaining a balanced scalp, mint contributes to healthier hair growth and prevents clogged hair follicles, allowing your hair to thrive. One of the key ingredients in this oil is biotin, a vitamin known for its hair-strengthening properties. Biotin supports the production of keratin, a protein essential for strong and resilient hair. By infusing the oil with biotin, Mielle ensures that your hair receives the necessary nourishment to grow longer and thicker. Biotin also helps reduce hair breakage and promotes overall hair health, resulting in a fuller and more voluminous appearance. To enjoy the benefits of Mielle Rosemary Mint Scalp & Hair Oil, simply apply a few drops to your fingertips and gently massage it into your scalp. The oil can be used on both damp and dry hair, making it versatile for any hair care routine. Massaging the oil into your scalp not only improves absorption but also stimulates blood circulation, enhancing the effectiveness of the product. With regular use, Mielle Rosemary Mint Scalp & Hair Oil can transform your hair care routine. It nourishes the scalp, promotes hair growth, and strengthens the hair shaft, reducing breakage and improving overall hair quality. The refreshing scent of rosemary and mint provides an invigorating experience, making your hair care routine a soothing and enjoyable self-care ritual. Mielle Rosemary Mint Scalp & Hair Oil is suitable for all hair types and is especially beneficial for those looking to encourage hair growth or address scalp issues. Incorporate this oil into your hair care regimen to experience the revitalizing effects of rosemary and mint, coupled with the growth-enhancing power of biotin.

Students and office workers can use rosemary oil to help improve memory.

Feature

100% PURE & NATURAL

Stimulates Hair Growth

Nourishes the Scalp

Strengthens Hair


HOW TO USE

Use 1-2 times a day, take a small amount of rosemary nourishment oil to the scalp and hair, and massage with fingers for 2-3 minutes until absorbed.


For Hair:

Massage it directly into your scalp

Take about 5 drops of rosemary essential oil and massage evenly into your scalp after a bath or shower. Mix with carrier oil (like jojoba oil or coconut oil). Rinsing out the oil afterwards is optional — though if you do rinse, first let the oil sit on your scalp for at least 5 to 10 minutes beforehand.

Mix it into your shampoo

This can also apply to conditioners, lotions, or creams. However, don’t add too much and keep to five drops per ounce of product. Afterwards, use the product as you usually would. You can also add 2 to 3 drops directly to any hair product when you apply a dollop on your palm before use.",SpecificationsColour NameGreen 5Size59 mlDepartmentWomen,,Hair & Scalp Treatments,EELHOE,['Hair & Scalp'],[],Treatment,"Dry scalp,Oily scalp,Hair loss,Seborrheic dermatitis",2.8047189562170503

Cool Color is exactly what you need: semi-permanent paint of a professional Spanish company that allows you to give bright touches and even change your appearance beyond recognition - without damaging your hair at all, and after a few weeks, you will return to the original. Look again - or you can keep trying new colors already.                                                                                                             The paint is gradually washed off, and, however, remains beautiful on the hair - it becomes more and more pastel and smoothly disappears - which is why the color does not look uneven at the roots. The application of the product is also very convenient: you do not need to pre-mix the composition with other components, and the bottle has a dispenser, so you can apply the paint either on individual strands or on the entire surface of the hair, ensuring uniform coverage in any case.                                Depending on your desire, you can give a light shade, enhance your natural color, or make a bright accent - just change the number and intensity of applications. Choose from 12 eye-catching colors in every color of the rainbow, from red to purple, including pearls and shiny metallic.
They can also be blended and create any imaginative lotion, incredibly embodied without harming the health of the hair due to its well-thought-out formula rich in vitamins, vegetable proteins, and oils, as well as hydrolyzed keratin. Hair will remain supple, soft, shiny, and shiny with incredible color - let your imagination run wild!

Q&A:
Q: How long does it take to effectively change the current hair quality problem?
A: New users have an adaptation period of 4 to 6 weeks. If you are using a natural shampoo/conditioner for the first time, your hair will most likely need an adjustment period, which is a good thing. It may take a month to clear out the build-up in your hair and scalp before you start to feel the benefits and get better naturally.
Q: Why does the shampoo taste different from traditional shampoo?
A: The ingredients of rosemary shampoo are derived from natural plants and do not add artificial flavors. The fragrance is plant-like and the taste is very pure. Please feel free to use it~
Q: Why does it feel a bit dry when used alone?
A: Rosemary shampoo does not contain silicone oil and has no fake slippery feeling. It is normal to feel dry.
Q: It has less foam than traditional shampoo. Can it clean your hair?
A: Shampoos with more foam contain chemical foaming agents, which can irritate the scalp. Rosemary shampoo uses plant-based cleansers instead of traditional chemical cleansers, which effectively cleans the scalp while being gentle and non-irritating, making hair smoother and shiny.",SpecificationsProduct Weight0.14 KGDepartmentUnisexWhat's In The BoxRosemary Mint Strengthening Shampoo*1Target Hair TypeAll Hair TypesFormationLiquidShelf Life3 yearModel NumberRosemary Mint Strengthening ShampooModel NameRosemary Mint Strengthening Shampoo,Model Number : Rosemary Mint Strengthening Shampoo,Shampoos & Conditioners,EELHOE,['Hair & Scalp'],[],Shampoo,"Hair loss,Dry scalp",2.5431471805599455
